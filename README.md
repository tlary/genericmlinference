# Generic Machine Learning Inference on Heterogenous Treatment Effects in Randomized Experiments

This repository contains R code that implements a methodology combining Machine Learning with classical econometric ideas to obtain unbiased and statistically valid results in Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Randomized Experiments developed by [Chernozhukov et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04802).
